						<p>Hi! My name is Akhila and I just graduated from Cornell University with a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science. More specifically, I am focused in computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence! This August, I will be starting as a Software Engineer at Google!</p>
                        <p>Some of my hobbies include hanging out with friends, kickboxing, reading, and keeping up with my many TV shows. Some of the shows I love include Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Bob's Burgers, South Park, Scrubs, and Gotham.</p>

						<h3 data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#project1">Analysis of the Anti-Vaccine Movement through Social Media</h3>
						<p id="project1" class="collapse in">This project was for the Data Science Hackathon at Cornell Tech. My team and I wanted to see what we could learn about the anti-vaccine movement through social media, specifically Twitter. We collected tweets from the past 10 days related to the movement and created a network graph of the users, hashtags, and linked websites. Nodes were connected if the users followed each other, a user mentioning a topic, or two topics in the same tweet. As we were trying to identify the two sides of the movement (for and against), we clustered the graph. To actually learn about the two movements, we created summaries of the tweets, hashtags, and linked websites for both sides. We were hoping to see if either side had a scientific base. We learned that the two sides are connected, so there was a bit of overlap in the summaries. Overall, this was an interesting study to see the role of social media in present day movements. This project could be expanded to be a Twitter analytics tool. To see the code, please click here.ccc</p>

						<p id="project2" class="collapse in">This project was for Cornell Data Science. I was on a team that wanted to create a smarter login for smartphones that takes into account keystrokes. We collected data and created a classifier that would authenticate a user. To see the code, please click here.</p>
