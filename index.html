						<p id="project1a" class="collapse in">This project was for the Data Science Hackathon at Cornell Tech. My team and I wanted to see what we could learn about the anti-vaccine movement through social media, specifically Twitter. We collected tweets from the past 10 days related to the movement and created a network graph of the users, hashtags, and linked websites. Nodes were connected if the users followed each other, a user mentioning a topic, or two topics in the same tweet. As we were trying to identify the two sides of the movement (for and against), we clustered the graph. To actually learn about the two movements, we created summaries of the tweets, hashtags, and linked websites for both sides. We were hoping to see if either side had a scientific base. We learned that the two sides are connected, so there was a bit of overlap in the summaries. Overall, this was an interesting study to see the role of social media in present day movements. This project could be expanded to be a Twitter analytics tool. To see the code, please click here.ccc</p>

			To extend the torque neural network made by a fellow classmate,
			I made a deep spatial autoencoder based on the work by Chelsea Finn et al.
			The goal was to take a blind robot and give it vision by automatically constructing the state-space directly from camera images and perform visuomotor learning. 
			It takes an image and encodes the positions of relevant objects in the world using Cartesian coordinates, generating a state-space.  
			Over time, as the objects move, the coordinates change.  The autoencoder takes the full-resolution RGB image and generate a low-dimensional, dense vector.  
			Unlike most autoencoders, this one encodes spatial feature locations instead of the actual feature values, as a way of representing the object’s location.
			This can be used as a representation of the state-space and is trained simultaneously with a neural network with an additional loss function.  
			This was part of a larger group project.

					We built and trained a deep network to learn an embedding using synthesized image data generated using iconic images of products and various backgrounds to see if synthesized data can improve the network.
					Training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) requires a lot of images, which can be expensive and time-consuming to acquire.  
					We attempted to obtain feasible results with our synthesized data, which can be generated cheaply and efficiently.
					We used iconic images of the products as ''anchors'' in our embedding, and synthesized new images by compositing the iconic image onto a background photograph.
					For training the network, we generated pairs of positive and negative examples for each iconic image with the synthetic images, and evaluated progress with both a triplet loss function and contrastive loss.
					We used GoogLeNet to generate the embedding for each loss function.We attempted to use the triplet loss and contrastive loss to separate dissimilar embeddings and cluster similar embeddings, both of which measure similarity with Euclidean distances.
					Our ultimate goal was to show that training a CNN to learn an embedding can be made cost-effective in time and monetary resources while still achieving high classification accuracy.
